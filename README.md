# BACKGROUND
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others to work to find optimal jobs.

# THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ANSWER THROUGH SQL QUERIES WERE:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# TOOLS I USED
- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgresSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# THE ANALYSIS
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
I analyze job market data to uncover insights that help professionals understand trends, especially in high-paying remote roles.

Hereâ€™s an example where I used SQL to extract the Top 10 Highest-Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs for 2023.

    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
